# The KK Factor

The website for **THE KK FACTOR — Roula Krikellis**: the Greek Eurobeat show
broadcast on RPP FM 98.7/98.3 and streamed live on YouTube.

One Node service serves both the REST API and the built React site, so the whole
thing runs on a single origin — no CORS to configure, and the refresh cookie is
never a third-party cookie (which Safari blocks by default).

## What it does

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Sponsors** | A strip across the top of every page, managed from the dashboard: add, remove, reorder, upload a logo, and count clicks. A sponsor with no website shows a phone number and email instead. |
| **Organisations** | The same records with `kind: organisation` — a sidebar of the bodies Roula supports. |
| **Community news** | Greek City Times, read from their WordPress API — the lead photo, the author, and the sections they filed it under. Held as a teaser and linked back, or in full where they have given permission. |
| **The show** | A live banner while she is on air, and an episode archive that fills itself from the YouTube channel feed. |
| **Going live** | One switch turns the banner on and writes the social post she pastes into Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and LinkedIn. |
| **The weekly slot** | Tuesdays 7.30–9.30pm, counted down on the site, offered as a calendar entry, and emailed to listeners who ask for it an hour before. Edited from the dashboard. |
| **Music** | Her own tracks, uploaded, in a player that survives navigation — and her YouTube playlist beside them, which is one pasted link and full-length playback for everyone. |
| **Gallery** | Photos and video from events. Video is a YouTube link rather than a file. |
| **Membership** | Free and Premium, shown as two cards the client edits from the dashboard. An episode can be marked for members and the lock is enforced on the server — nothing takes payment, and the Premium card says so. |

## Running it

You need **Node 18 or newer** and a MongoDB connection string (Atlas M0 is free).

```bash
# 1. Configuration
cd server
cp .env.example .env          # then fill in MONGODB_URI and the two JWT secrets

# 2. Install
npm install
npm install --prefix ../client

# 3. Content
npm run db:seed               # admin account, categories, radio placeholders
npm run db:partners           # the sponsors and organisations
npm run feeds:refresh         # news from Greek City Times, episodes from YouTube

# 4. Run — two terminals
npm run dev                   # API on :5000
npm run dev --prefix ../client   # site on :5173
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/uploads` to `:5000`, so the browser
sees one origin in development too.

### Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | API with reload |
| `npm start` | API, production mode |
| `npm test` | The test suite — no database needed, runs in under a second |
| `npm run db:seed` | Admin account, categories, radio placeholders. Add `-- --demo-articles` for sample stories. |
| `npm run db:partners` | Sponsors and organisations |
| `npm run feeds:refresh` | Pull the news and the episode archive once |
| `npm run news:categories` | List the publisher's sections with story counts, and suggest a set |
| `npm run build` | Installs and builds the client into `client/dist` |

## How it is put together

```
server/
  app.js            middleware, static files, the built client
  server.js         boot: connect, build indexes, listen, start the importers
  config/           validated environment; every process.env read lives here
  models/           Mongoose schemas
  controllers/      one file per resource
  routes/           a list of gates, then a controller
  services/         the two feed importers and their scheduler
  middleware/       auth, uploads, rate limits, the single error funnel
  utils/            tokens, sanitising, slugs, pagination, media removal
  seed-assets/      images that ship with the repo (see below)
  tests/

client/src/
  pages/            one per route
  components/       Sponsors, Show, News, MusicPlayer, Admin, common
  context/          Auth, Player, Theme
  hooks/            useFetch, useAuth, usePlayer, useDebounce, …
  utils/            the axios instance and every endpoint helper
```

Every request follows the same shape: **a list of gates, then a controller**.
`POST /api/articles` passes through a rate limit, `requireAuth`, `requireAdmin`
and the field validators before the controller ever runs, and anything thrown
anywhere lands in one error handler that emits one JSON envelope. Read one route
file and you can read them all.

### Decisions worth knowing

**The episode archive fills itself.** She streams live on YouTube; YouTube keeps
the recording as an ordinary video the moment the stream ends; the importer reads
the channel's public Atom feed. No API key, no quota, and nobody uploads
anything. The feed carries no duration, which is why that one field is typed in
by hand.

**The schedule is a wall-clock time, not an instant.** "Tuesdays at 7.30pm"
means 7.30pm in Melbourne, which is 09:30 UTC for half the year and 08:30 for
the other half. Storing the weekday, the time and the zone and resolving them
per request is what keeps the show at 7.30 across the daylight-saving change
instead of drifting an hour; the browser is only ever handed an instant to
count down to, so nothing on the client has to reason about somebody else's
daylight saving. `utils/schedule.js` does it with `Intl` and no dependency.

**The music is in two players, on purpose.** Uploaded tracks play in the
site's own player, which lives outside the router and therefore keeps playing
while a listener moves around the site — but somebody has to upload each one,
and a commercial recording streamed on demand needs a licence a broadcast one
does not cover. A YouTube playlist is one pasted link, plays in full for
everyone, and needs no licence arranged, because embedding is covered by
YouTube's own agreements — but it is an iframe on one page and stops when you
navigate away. Spotify was the third option and is not here: Spotify's
documentation says an embed will "only stream a preview clip of less than 30
seconds" in some situations, and full playback depends on the visitor being
signed in to Spotify themselves.

**Reminders are a calendar entry first, and an email second.** A `.ics` file and a
Google Calendar link work on every phone and desktop, survive the reader
clearing their browser, and ask for nothing — no permission prompt, no email
address, no record of the reader here. Browser push is the option that is not here: Apple
allows it only once a site has been added to the home screen, which is a step
most people never take, so it would reach fewer people than either of these
while costing a subscription record per reader.

The email list is double opt-in — an address does nothing until the person who
owns it clicks a link — because anyone can type anyone's address into a box on
the internet, and because consent, an identified sender and a working
unsubscribe are what the Spam Act asks of an Australian sender. The reminder
rides along with the half-hourly feed refresh rather than having a scheduled
job of its own, since a second job is a second thing to forget, and forgetting
this one is silent: a reminder that never goes out looks exactly like a
reminder nobody subscribed to.

**Going live is a switch, not a detector.** Asking YouTube whether a channel is
on air needs the Data API, and polling it would spend the whole daily quota
answering a question the presenter already knows — she is pressing "go live" on
YouTube at that moment anyway.

**The site does not post to social media.** It cannot: TikTok keeps anything an
unaudited app publishes private, Instagram needs a business account and Meta's
app review, and LinkedIn does not open personal-profile posting to ordinary
developers. So the site writes the post and she pastes it.

**News comes from the publisher's API, and falls back to their feed.** A
WordPress site already offers `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts` with no key and no quota,
and it is better than RSS in every way that matters here: the lead photo as a
real URL rather than a page to scrape for an `og:image`, the sections a story
was filed under, the author's name, and a hundred posts a page going back years
instead of the latest fifteen. The RSS reader is kept for the day that API is
turned off. Both sources identify a story by the same `?p=<id>`, so switching
between them updates what is already stored rather than duplicating it — and
the API import is about five times faster, because it fetches no article pages.

**Whether the whole article is stored is a legal switch, not a technical one.**
Both sources hand the body over freely; that is not a licence to republish it.
`NEWS_FULL_TEXT` is off until the publisher has agreed in writing. With it on,
imported stories open here — with the byline, the credit above the article, the
credit below it, and a `rel=canonical` pointing at the original, because two
copies of an article on the web without one costs the publisher their ranking.
With it off they open on the publisher's site, and the client decides which by
reading `is_full_text` off the record rather than by knowing anything about
configuration. Permission for the text is not permission for the photographs;
that is worth settling separately.

**`seed-assets/` survives a wiped disk.** A free host's filesystem is erased on
every restart while the database keeps pointing at `/uploads/...`. The sponsor
logos and the sample media ship inside the repository and are served as a
fallback, so the strip across the top of the site can never come up empty.
Anything an editor uploads goes to Cloudinary under an absolute URL and never
reaches that handler.

**The membership cards do not take money, and say so.** The client wanted the
levels visible before there is anything to sell. So Premium reads "Coming
soon", carries a badge, is followed by a line saying no payment is taken, and
its button opens an email rather than a checkout. A page that looks like it
takes payment and does not is worse than no page. The wording lives in a
setting because what Premium includes is still being decided, and deciding it
should not need a deploy.

**Imported articles are stripped of the publisher's furniture.** A newsroom's
article body is not only the article: Greek City Times inject ad slots holding
a consent-gated script and a small label reading "Advertising1". The sanitiser
drops the script and leaves the label sitting in the prose, where it reads as
though we wrote it.

**Premium is enforced on the server.** A locked episode is still listed — being
able to see that something exists is the point of a members tier — but the video
id is stripped from the response before it leaves the API.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

142 tests, no database, under two seconds. They cover the places this project has
actually had bugs: slug collisions, HTML entities in imported headlines, the six
shapes a YouTube link arrives in, pagination clamping, the fact that a refresh
token can never be presented as an access token, the site being allowed to call
its own API, the syndication trailer that — with the obvious regex — ate every
article containing the words "appeared first on", both nights a year when
Melbourne's clocks move, and the seam between a helper and its one caller —
which is where the ad-label strip was written correctly and then not called.

---

## Deploying

`DEPLOY-STEPS.md` walks through it end to end on free plans — Render, MongoDB
Atlas, Cloudinary and cron-job.org. `render.yaml` is a blueprint for the same
thing.

Two things that are easy to get wrong:

- **`MONGODB_URI` must name the database.** Without `/kk_factor` before the `?`,
  the driver silently uses a database called `test`.
- **The feed refresh needs an outside scheduler.** A free instance sleeps after
  15 idle minutes and a sleeping instance runs no timers, so something has to
  call `POST /api/import/run` from outside.

---

## Licensing, before this goes public

Three things are the client's to sort out, not the code's:

1. **Music.** A broadcast licence covers playing music on air. It does not cover
   the same music streamed on demand from her own website. If uploaded tracks or
   full episodes contain commercial recordings, that is a separate licence
   (APRA AMCOS and PPCA in Australia).
2. **News.** Publishing Greek City Times' full articles needs their written
   permission. Headlines, excerpts and links back do not.
3. **Logos.** Every sponsor and organisation logo needs permission to use it.
   Showing an organisation's mark can read as an endorsement.
